# Kurukshetra Commentary (Anonymous)

## Intent
This site contains brief, episode-by-episode commentary on the animated series *Kurukshetra: The Great War of Mahabharata*.
The goal is to clarify context that may be lost in translation or compressed by the format, and to make the story more accessible to readers who did not grow up with the Mahabharata tradition.

These notes are meant to be:
- short and readable (not academic)
- respectful of different interpretations
- focused on context, terminology, and “what’s missing” rather than judging characters

If you have suggestions or corrections, please share them with whoever sent you this link.
