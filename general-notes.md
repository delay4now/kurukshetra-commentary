Below is some commentary which is helpful to read before watching the animated series *Kurukshetra: The Great War of Mahabharata* on Netflix.

## <u>On Concepts of Dharma and Karma</u>

<u>Tl;dr: Dharma refers to the static inner principle of essential nature and the integral harmony of existence, while Karma refers to the dynamic "action" that outwardly manifests that nature within the world of becoming.</u>

**Dharma:** Dharma, derived from the root *dhri* (to sustain, maintain, or carry), represents the fundamental principle of stability and the essential "manner of being" for all things. It operates not as a personal or moral decree, but as an objective "universal will" or cosmic intelligence that governs both macrocosmic cycles and human social orders through integral harmony. Consequently, *adharma* is neither "sin" nor "evil" in a theological sense, but simply a rupture of equilibrium or a deviation from the nature of beings. When applied to the societal level, Dharma manifests as juridical law (*shastra*), which is formulated in codes considered *smriti* (reflected rational consciousness) rather than *shruti* (direct intuition) to maintain hierarchical relations. At the individual level, this universal law is particularized as *svadharma*, the specific law proper to each being, which is determined by their unique nature and dispositions, defining how they must conduct themselves to remain in conformity with the total order.

**Karma:** Karma, distinct from popular notions of fate, is strictly defined as the dynamic action by which the static inner disposition of *dharma* is manifested outwardly. While *dharma* constitutes the essential "manner of being", Karma operates as the necessary process of "becoming", valid only when it remains "normal", that is, in strict conformity with the nature of the being and its state of existence. Because action lacks its own sufficient reason, it is inherently subordinate to the immutable principle of Knowledge. When applied to the societal level, Karma serves as the operating mechanism for the functionalities of the various castes, representing the principle of mobility; for example, in the case of the Kshatriya (warrior) caste, it manifests as the active power of the social order that executes temporal authority. At the individual level, it represents the inevitable engagement of the finite individuality within the field of action, serving as the vehicle through which one's specific nature (*svadharma*) is externalized and realized.

## <u>Main Characters and their Relationship</u>

<u>Tl;dr: The conflict centers on the Pāṇḍavas, led by Yudhiṣṭhira and the warrior-hero Arjuna, who, guided by the divine non-combatant Krishna (his cousin), battle the Kauravas (also their cousins) and their oath-bound elders in a dharmic struggle chronicled by the sage Vyāsa.</u>

**1. The Central Protagonists, Pāṇḍavas:** The five sons of Pāṇḍu are:

- **Arjuna:** The third Pāṇḍava and the principal archer of the epic. In the context of the battle, he is the hero engaged in the quest, mounted on the chariot.
- **Yudhiṣṭhira:** The eldest Pāṇḍava.
- **Bhīma:** The second brother, possessing immense physical strength.
- **Nakula & Sahadeva:** The twins.
- **Draupadi:** The common wife of the Pāṇḍavas, whose humiliation acts as the catalytic cause of the war.

**2. The Antagonists, Kauravas:** The one hundred sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra (Pāṇḍu's blind brother). The main characters to remember though are:

- **Duryodhana:** The eldest Kaurava.
- **Duḥśāsana:** His younger brother, the executor of Duryodhana's will.
- **Dhṛtarāṣṭra:** The blind king and father of the Kauravas.

**3. The Divine Mediator, Krishna:** The Prince of Dvārakā and cousin to both sides and is the 8th *incarnation* of the divine Viṣhṇu.

**4. The Elders and Commanders:** Figures bound by oaths or duty to fight for the throne (Kauravas), despite their personal affection for the Pāṇḍavas.

- **Bhīṣma:** The "Grandsire" of both clans.
- **Droṇa:** The preceptor (*guru*) who taught martial arts to both the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas.
- **Karna:** The secret eldest brother of the Pāṇḍavas (son of Kuntī and the Sun), who fights for Duryodhana out of loyalty and friendship.

**5. The Narrator and Progenitor**

- **Vyāsa:** The sage who chronicles the epic and is the biological grandfather of both the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas. It is essential to note that traditionally, the name "Vyāsa" denotes a cosmic "function" (that of arranging or compiling the Vedas) rather than merely a specific historical man. He represents the intellectual capacity to detach and observe the unfolding of the dynastic struggle.

## <u>Context for the War (Kurukshetra)</u>

<u>Tl;dr: The Kurukshetra War occurred at the twilight of the Dvāpara Yuga, precipitated by the Kauravas' usurpation of the throne and their fundamental violation of Dharma during the Game of Dice. Following the collapse of diplomatic efforts, this dynastic feud escalated into a catastrophic 18-day military conflict that resulted in the devastation of the contending armies, a necessary cataclysm that ultimately restored rightful sovereignty.</u>

**The Narrative Arc: From Discord to Dissolution:** The war is historically situated at the twilight of the Dvāpara Yuga, serving as the cataclysmic transition that ushers in the **Kali Yuga** (the Age of Discord). To provide proper scope, one could note that the Dvāpara Yuga is the third age and the Kali Yuga the fourth, functioning within a four-phase *Manvantara* (which then repeats and further fits into even higher-order cycles). It is important to distinguish this specific transition from the ultimate dissolution; while the tenth incarnation of Vishnu, **Kalki**, would arrive at the cataclysmic end of the Kali Yuga, this war marks the *descent* into the age. While the fighting occurs in the former age, the conflict is precipitated by the rising influence of *adharma* (disorder)—a defining characteristic of the incoming Dark Age. This cosmic shift manifests concretely in the dynastic feud between the **Kauravas** and **Pāṇḍavas** over the throne of Hastinapura. The seed of the conflict lies in the fundamental violation of the "Law of Harmony" when the blind king Dhṛtarāṣṭra allows his son Duryodhana's envy to override the legitimate succession rights of the Pāṇḍavas.

**The Catalyst: The Game of Dice and the Collapse of Order:** The precipitating cause of the war was not merely political rivalry, but a specific, ritualized dismantling of *Dharma* during the infamous **Game of Dice** (*Dyūt*). In this event, the Kauravas utilized deceit to strip the Pāṇḍavas of their kingdom and freedom, culminating in the attempted disrobing of their common wife, **Draupadi**, in the royal court. Metaphysically, this act represented the total collapse of the "family" structure and the protection of the feminine principle, which can be identified as a primary symptom of the darkening age. Following this humiliation, the Pāṇḍavas endured a **13-year exile**, a period of penance and preparation. When they returned to claim their rightful share, the conflict escalated from a personal vendetta to a necessary restoration of cosmic order.

**The Diplomatic Failure and Inevitability:** The final rupture occurred when the Kauravas, led by Duryodhana, refused the Pāṇḍavas even five villages during **Krishna's peace mission**, famously declaring that he would not yield enough land to hold the point of a needle. This diplomatic failure confirmed that the forces of disorder had become entrenched and unyielding, making "surgical" destruction the only means to restore equilibrium before the new cycle could begin.

**The Scale and Nature of the Conflict:** The battle itself is a "total war" fought over **18 days** on the sacred field of Kurukshetra (*Dharmakshetra*), involving the mobilization of **18 Akshauhinis** (vast military formations), with 11 aligned with the Kauravas and 7 with the Pāṇḍavas. The sheer scale of the engagement—pitting **the Pāṇḍavas** against their own elders and teachers like **Bhīṣma** and **Droṇa**—transforms the battlefield into a crucible for the Kṣatriya (warrior) function. For the protagonist **Arjuna**, the war is a crisis of conscience where the "sentimental" refusal to slay his kin clashes with the "intellectual" necessity of performing his *svadharma* (caste duty). The war concludes with a Pyrrhic victory for the Pāṇḍavas, where the near-total annihilation of the combatants serves as the ritual purification required to cleanse the earth of its accumulated burdens.
