Below is a commentary on Episode 1 of the animated series *Kurukshetra: The Great War of Mahabharata* on Netflix.

## <u>New Characters Introduced in the Episode</u>

1\. **Abhimanyu** (@2:40): The son of Arjuna and Subhadrā (Krishna's sister).

2\. **Gāndhārī** (@3:48): The wife of the blind king Dhṛtarāştra and mother of the hundred Kauravas. She is the Queen Mother who voluntarily blindfolded herself to share her husband's darkness.

3\. **Sanjay** (@8:50): The charioteer and advisor to Dhṛtarāştra. He is the Narrator within the narrative, endowed with *divya drşți* (divine sight) by the sage Vyāsa.

4\. **Shakuni** (@19:52): The maternal uncle of the Kauravas and the King of Gandhara. He is the Mastermind of the conflict, representing the "subversive intelligence" that operates through cunning and deceit rather than valor.

## <u>High Level Commentary</u>

The first episode is titled "Sanjay." Sanjay is a disciple of Sage Vyasa, and on the eve of the war Vyasa grants him *divya drşți* (divine vision) so that the blind King Dhritarashtra, who could not bear to witness the carnage himself, can still be kept informed. Through this gift, Sanjay can perceive distant events within his mind as though seeing them in person; moreover, he hears the sounds with the physical ear, not merely as a current of thought.

The episode centers on Sanjay as messenger and charioteer, tasked with delivering difficult news to the blind King Dhṛtarāşțra and, throughout the war, narrating events to him. He is not a mere reporter. Through his *divya dṛṣți*, he embodies the detached witness, an "intellectual witness" who sees the whole without being consumed by it. 

Accordingly, the episode focuses on the collapse of peace talks-the moment when "words" (intellectual negotiation/Brahminical power) are exhausted and "force" (action/Kshatriya power) becomes the only remaining vehicle for Dharma. The war is not a "failure" of policy, but a necessary ritual purification (a *yajña* or sacrifice) required to clear the accumulated burden of the earth.

In summary, by starting with Sanjay as the episode's anchor, the show frames the war as something to be seen and understood before it is fought, placing the viewer in the position of the witness.

## <u>Miscellaneous Remarks and References</u>

**1\.** In the original Mahabharata, Sanjay remains with King Dhritarashtra in Hastinapura throughout the 18 days of the Kurukshetra war and narrates the battlefield events using his *divya drşți*. By contrast, the web series depicts him moving between places, which is inaccurate.

**2\.** One may interpret Sanjay as standing between the field of action (Kurukshetra) and the field of ignorance (the blind king's palace). His function is to perceive the "totality" of events without being swept away by their *rajasic* (passionate) turbulence. He is the intellect observing the unfolding of destiny. In fact, the series adopts a specific structure in which each episode is named after, and focuses on, the perspective of a single warrior (e.g., Ep 1: Sanjay, Ep 2: Vishwaroop, Ep 3: Bhishm), thereby dissecting the "function" of each character in the war.

**3\.** At 6:00, the episode includes a prayer from *Bhagavad Gītā* 4.7-4.8:
  > *yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata |*<br>
  > *abhyutthānam adharmasya tadātmānam sṛjāmy aham*<br>
  > *paritrāṇāya sādhūnām vināśāya ca duşkṛtām |*<br>
  > *dharma-samsthāpanārthāya sambhavāmi yuge yuge*

A literal translation is roughly: "Whenever there is a decline of *dharma* and a rise of *adharma*, then I manifest Myself to restore the *dharma*". However, one can read this as saying that when the manifested world deviates too far from its principle of stability (*dharma*), the Universal Being intervenes through *avatāra* to neutralize disorder (*adharma*) and restore the equilibrium necessary for the cycle to continue.

In fact, while the show presents this prayer as Krishna's introduction in the episode, suggesting that he manifested to establish order, it is also often heard in the context of an apocalyptic warning: that the end is near, destruction is imminent, and a new cycle will consequently begin (for example see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVfHco4dKZw">here</a>).

**4\.** At 9:40, Sanjay raises the central question, "Who am I?" In the Indian contemplative traditions, this is not a casual psychological query but a canonical orientation toward what is ultimately real. *Advaita Vedānta*, for instance, crystallizes this direction through the *mahāvākyas* ("great sayings") such as *tat tvam asi* ("You are That") and related formulations that point the seeker from the changing field of experience to the identity of *Atman* and *Brahman*.

The same inward turn is especially explicit in the practice of self-inquiry associated with Sri Ramana Maharshi, where "Who am I?" is treated as a direct method rather than a request for a conceptual answer. Within the idiom of the *Aşțāvakra Gītā* as well, the resolution of the question is repeatedly expressed as recognition of oneself as the *sākṣī* (the witness or seer) distinct from the shifting contents of body and mind. In that light, it is prescient that Sanjay, positioned by the narrative precisely as the witness to events, voices the question "Who am I?" at the threshold of the story.

**5\.** At 13:45, the episode implicitly echoes *Bhagavad Gītā* 2.47:
  > *karmany evādhikāras te mā phaleșu kadācana |*<br>
  > *mā karma-phala-hetur bhūr mā te sango 'stu akarmaņi*

A literal translation is roughly: "You have the right to action alone, never to its fruits. Do not make the fruits of action your motive, and do not cling to inaction". In the episode, however, the "fruit" is offered to Sanjay by Krishna himself. The turn of events is presented as something given, not something Sanjay should graple with or act on, but must simply accept.
